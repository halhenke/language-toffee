# Toffee Templating language package

Recently discovered the templating language [toffee](https://github.com/malgorithms/toffee) and fell in love.
Heavily inspired by Coffeescript I think its far preferable to the EJS style syntax that is favoured by generators like Yeoman & Slush and lodash.

This is my attempt to produce a syntax for the Atom editor.
